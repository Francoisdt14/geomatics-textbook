## What is LiDAR?

LiDAR is an active remote sensing technology that uses a laser scanner and time of flight principles to collect 3 dimensional (3D) data. A LiDAR system is made up of three components; a laser-scanning device, and accurate global navigation satellite system (GNSS), and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The GNSS receiver allows the position of the laser to be determined in space, while the IMU records the orientation of the laser (i.e. roll, pitch, and yaw). Figure 15.1 shows all of the necessary components of a LiDAR system. When discussing LiDAR in an airborne context, we can also call it airborne laser scanning (ALS).

![Figure 15.1 Overview of the components of a LiDAR System.](images/15-LiDAR_System.png){width="50%"}

### How Does it Work?

Typical LiDAR systems use the time of flight method to produce 3D data. A laser ranging instrument produces a short, intense pulse of light from the instrument to a target being measured. Some of this energy is then reflected back to the instrument, where it is recorded (as seen in Figure 15.2). Since the speed of light, and the location of the laser ranging instrument is known, we can calculate the position of the target by timing how long it takes between the the pulse being emitted and received. If we shoot many pulses of light towards a target, we can create a 3D point cloud of our target (see Figure 15.8 as an example of a forest scene). Modern LiDAR systems can shoot hundreds of thousands of pulses per second, which means LiDAR point clouds can contain millions of points, and be several gigabytes large (Figure 15.3).

![Figure 15.2 Concept of LiDAR.](images/15-Concept_of_LiDAR.png){.center}

Since a LiDAR point cloud is a file containing the three dimensional location of points representing objects on the Earth's surface, there are several parameters to take note of. It is important to know what the technical specifications of the data collection parameters were (for example, what was is the point density?), and how the data was collected (what plaform was used?). A LiDAR dataset includes several pieces of information for each 3D point. `X,Y,Z` location data is included, as well as a GPS time stamp for each point (`gpstime`). Additional information such as `return number`, `scan angle`, `classification`, and `intensity` are also part of the file. We will discuss these concepts in more detail below.

The most common file format for LiDAR files is called the LAS file format (`.las`). This file format was originally designed for 3-dimensional point cloud data, and is a free alternative to proprietary systems or a generic ASCII file interchange system. The main benefits of this file format are that it is relatively quick, can be used by any system, and stores information specific to the nature of LiDAR data without being overly complex. More information regarding the file type specifications can be found [here](https://www.asprs.org/divisions-committees/lidar-division/laser-las-file-format-exchange-activities){target="_blank"}.

![Figure 15.3 An example of a typical LiDAR point cloud containing 3.14 million points at approximately 80 p/m^2^.](images/15-las_denoise.png){width="90%"}

## LiDAR History and Use

LiDAR for forestry and ecology can be used to monitor vegetation structure, stream properties, and topography among other uses. Early LiDAR point densities were low (1 - 5 p/m^2^), which limited researchers to area based measurements of forest volume and biomass in the 1980s (CITE NELSON 2013). These limitations were primarily due to the LiDAR sensor, as well as data storage difficulties. Technological improvements such as increased pulse rates and smaller footprints (leading to increased point density), and increased storage capacity have allowed researchers to look as individual trees as well as whole forests (CITE Jakubowski 2013). ALS point cloud densities of 1000 p/m^2^ are now entirely feasible.

![Figure 15.X A cross section of a high density point cloud (A, X p/m^2^), and a lower density point cloud (B, 1 p/m^2^)](images/15-high_low_point_density.png)

Unlike passive remote sensing technologies, LiDAR has the advantage of being able penetrate forest canopies; this means that we are able to detect the ground. LiDAR can be used to map and examine man-made and natural environments, as the data is extremely precise. It can be used in hazard assessment, forestry, agriculture, wet area mapping, and geologic mapping. In this chapter, we will discuss it's use primarily in a forestry context, where it can be used for volume and biomass estimation, as well as individual tree crown analyses.

## Components of a LiDAR System

### Lasers

Lasers are a very important component of LiDAR systems. Here we will discuss some basic concepts, as well as the technical parameters that are important when interpreting LiDAR data. LiDAR lasers are typically beams of near-infrared light (e.g. 1064 nm)(4:10 - video 1), as these wavelengths are considered eye safe. Green wavelengths can be used for bathymetric LiDAR (i.e. water penetrating LiDAR), but are not commonly used on land (video 1). Beam divergence refers to how wide the light beam becomes, and can be used to differentiate LiDAR instruments. Small-footprint LiDAR describes beam diameters intercepting the suface at <1m, while large-footprint
intercepts the surface at around 5-25m (FIND CITATION).Small-footprint LiDAR is primarily what is used commercially, and has high accuracy and the ability to produce high sampling densities. All LiDAR sensors emit pulses at a certain rate; in the early 2000's 80 000 pulses/second was common; now we can emit up to 260 000 pulses/second. As you can imagine, this leads to a large increase in pulse density! Similar to satellite sensors (call back to X chapter;Paul), LiDAR sensors scan in a variety of ways. Zig-zag, rotation mirror line, and push broom scanners are the most common (video 2, 2:08). *Finally, power is important to take into account because...*. This means that each LiDAR flight has the potential to be rather unique, and all of the factors listed above need to be taken into account when doing analysis, as these factors affect how the pulse interacts with the target (if you would like to see more on this specifically, see HERE - 7:45 in video 1 (affects return)).

-   **Technical Specifications of lasers**

    Several technical aspects of lasers are recorded by the instrument (and usually provided as a flight summary or flight specifications by vendors), while some of it can also be found in the `las` file. We can usually find information that impacts the entire flight in the flight specifications, such as flight height, scan rate, and beam divergence. These aspects shouldn't change for the entire duration of the flight. In contrast, information located in the `las` file affects individual points. Here we can find information such as scan angle, return number, and intensity. 

- Table for what each refers to? 

![Figure 15.4 An example of a LiDAR Unit.](images/15-LiDAR_Unit.jpg){width="50%"}

### Position and Orientation

-   **Global Navigation Satellite Systems**

    In order for us to use the calculation from Figure 15.2, we need to know the exact position of the scanner in space. For airborne and mobile platforms, we can can do this by using an on board global positioning system (GPS), as well as post processing using local GPS reference station. This helps us to improve accuracy by not comparing our position to a known local position in order to ensure our location is known as accurately as possible. GPS concepts are covered further in Chapter 4.

![Figure 15.5 An on board GPS is required to for providing an accurate location of the LiDAR scanner.](images/15-XYZ_coordinates.jpg){width="75%"}

-   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)**

    An inertial measurement unit (IMU) consists of gyroscopes and accelerometers and measures the attitude and acceleration of the aircraft along the X, Y, Z axis. This data is combined with the GNSS data to provide a precise location of the scanner in space. This information becomes very important for airborne platforms where wind conditions can cause the orientation of the scanner to change subtly. We refer to the orientation of the platform in space by using the terms pitch, roll, and yaw, to describe which was the scanner is facing (see Figure 15.1).

-   **Clocks**

    LiDAR point data needs to be synched with positioning data in order to know exactly where the point is in space. To do this, a very accurate GPS clock is used to time stamp the laser scanning data (7:30 video 2). Accurate clocks are imperative for producing accurate point clouds; one nanosecond (i.e. one billionth of a second) corresponds to a 30 cm travel distance (as seen in Figure 15.X)! (video 1)

### Platform

LiDAR units can be attached to a variety of platforms. Traditionally, LiDAR units for forestry research were mounted on airplanes and helicopters, as units were large and cumbersome [Figure 15.X], however ground based units such as terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and mobile laser scanning (MLS) have also been developed. These units tend to have a very high point density, and TLS is often used in modeling tree architecture.

-   **Airplanes and Helicopters**

Airplanes and helicopters are still the most common platforms for LiDAR data collection. This is due to their ability to collect large amounts of data in one acquisition. LiDAR units that are designed for airplanes are more powerful than those designed for drones, leading to increased penetration in forests, even though the flight height is significantly increased. Data storage issues can also be mitigated as the platform is not as sensitive to weight restrictions when compared to drones. With increased pulse rates, data acquisitions can also be dense enough to do individual tree crown work. Typical point densities range from 5-200 p/m^2^.

-   **Drone**

As laser units have decreased in size, we have been able to mount LiDAR units to smaller platforms. Drones (also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or remotely piloted aerial systems (RPAS)) are extremely convenient to collect high density point clouds over small areas. They typically fly relatively close to the forest (e.g. 50m above the trees) and fly a predined flight route so ensure evenly spaced data collection. Typical point densities range from hundreds to thousands of points per meter squared. A major limitation of drones is currently battery life, as acquisition campaigns are limited by how long the drone can fly for (approximately 20 minutes). This means that collecting large amounts of data is difficult in remote locations.

![Figure 15.6 Drone mounted LiDAR.](images/15-LiDAR_on_Drone_2.jpg){width="75%"}

-   **Mobile Laser Scanning**

Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) includes people (sometimes called 'backpack LiDAR') and moving vehicles. This version of LiDAR have been used by transportation and engineering companies to precisely map things like road or building conditions, and as the units have reduced in size there has been and increase in interest for use in forestry. Current MLS units such as Figure 15.X.2 can be carried around by the user in a forest easily. [Specs from Spencer for GeoSLAM]. Typical point densities are in the hundreds to thousands of points per meter squared. This is highly dependent on what the MLS is mounted to!

-   **Terrestrial Laser Scanning**

Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) is a static system. These units are used by engineers for surveying, and are used by foresters to precisely measure trees. This information can be used to build Quantitative structure models (QSM), to precisely estimate tree parameters. Unlike the other platforms mentioned here, TLS is not necessarily a fast data collection technique. Due to occlusion, the TLS instrument needs to be placed in multiple positions around a plot to be able to fully visualize the trees, which means that a plot can take [cite how long a plot can take] to survey! Typical point densities are in the thousands of points per meter squared.

-   **Satellite**

The last platform that LiDAR units are used for is on satellites. The two major satellite LiDAR systems are ICESat, and GEDI. - ICESat **FIND MORE REFERENCES**

## Types of LiDAR

### Discrete Return

Discrete return LiDAR = most common. Include figure of a cross-section! 1:10 in video 3 - energy detected from the return has to meet a certain threshold to become a return Classified returns by the arrival sequence - e.g. 1st return = high canopy, or ground if there is no vegetation

### Full Waveform

Issue of data storage - now becoming a viable alternative. Look at Figure 15.8 for example 3:00 video 3 - record complete signal at high sampling rates for further processing

## LiDAR Derivatives and Analysis

LiDAR point clouds require post processing to be useful.

Point classification is important!

-   What can we do with LiDAR derivatives, why are they important... tie in with LiDAR history (examples from NCC LiDAR Lecture)
-   How do we go from raw cloud to these derivatives - incorporate case study?
-   LiDAR metrics = descriptive statistics from the point cloud over a unit area. How we define that unit is decides what kind of analysis we are able to do, and what kind of inferences are possible.

### Bare Earth Elevation

Digital elevataion models (DEMs) represent the Earth's surface.\
- What is a DEM - also known as digital terrain model - To create DEMs, we need to Rasterization vs TIN - call back to previous topic?

-   CHM vs DSM? ... basically the same thing just includes everything...

### Area Based Approach vs. Individual Tree Crown Approach

LiDAR analysis in forestry uses two broad approaches, an area-based approach (ABA), or an individual tree detection approach (ITD). The ITD approach locates individual trees and allows the estimation of individual tree heights and crown area. From this, other metrics such as stem diameter, number of stems, basal area and stem volume can be derived (Hyyppä and Inkinen 1999). In contrast, the main goal of an ABA is to generate wall-to-wall estimates of inventory attributes, such as mean height, dominant height, mean diameter, stem number, basal area, and volume of the stands (Næsset 2002).

![Figure 15.14 Example of tree tops detected by algorithm.](images/15-las_treetops.png){.center}

### Software and Analysis Tools

As LiDAR acquisition becomes cheaper, more tools are becoming available to do analysis. In this chapter, we use [lidR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lidR/){target="_blank"}; a free and open source R package that can be used for the entire process of analyzing a point cloud. Several other options exist, such as [A Shiny-based Application for Extracting Forest Information from LiDAR data](https://github.com/carlos-alberto-silva/weblidar-treetop){target="_blank"} (also in R), the [Digital-Forestry-Toolbox](http://mparkan.github.io/Digital-Forestry-Toolbox/){target="_blank"} which is available for MATLAB, or [FUSION](http://forsys.cfr.washington.edu/fusion/fusion_overview.html){target="_blank"}, a software developed by the USDA Forest Service. Paid software is also frequently used in LiDAR processing (examples include [ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/las-dataset/use-lidar-in-arcgis-pro.htm){target="_blank"}, and [LAStools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/){target="_blank"}), although the cost can be prohibitive. Finally, the open source software [CloudCompare](https://www.danielgm.net/cc/){target="_blank"} can be incredibly useful for both viewing and manually clipping/editing point clouds.

#### Creating LiDAR Metrics from a Raw Point Cloud {#box-text .unnumbered}

<p id="box-text">

For this case study, we will be using a clipped .las file from the 2018 open [LiDAR dataset](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/lidar-2018/information/){target="_blank"} of the City of Vancouver and UBC Endowment Lands in British Columbia (we randomly selected a 200 x 200 meter portion of the '4840E_54550N' tile using CloudCompare), and the `lidR` package in R. The script to process this data is included HERE [where to include script?], and you can use the `lidR` [book](https://jean-romain.github.io/lidRbook/){target="_blank"} to get a more in depth understanding of the functions we apply below.

</p>

<p id="box-text">

The first step when looking at LiDAR data is to inspect it; we recommend using the free software CloudCompare, or the `plot()` function in the `lidR` package. Once we have a sense of our data, we can clean and filter the data, using `classify_noise()` and the '-drop' switch to get rid of the noise in our dataset. Our cleaned dataset can then be used to create a DEM; first we need to classify ground points (`classify_ground()`), followed by using the `grid_terrain()` function in order to rasterize our new ground points. This is an essential step that could require quite a bit of tweaking depending on what you want to use the DEM for! In our case, the DEM is used to *normalize* the point cloud. Normalization removes the effect of terrain on above ground measurements, allowing comparisons of vegetation heights (as can see in the very uniform point cloud in Figure 15.X).

![Figure 15.X A normalized point cloud](images/15-las_normalize.png){width="50%"}

</p>

<p id="box-text">

The normalized point cloud is used to create our CHM (created using `grid_canopy()`). It is at this point that we can analyze the point cloud in a variety of ways. We can use an area-based approach (ABA) to create metrics at the grid level (`grid_metrics()`), or we can derive metrics at the individual tree scale. In order to do this we need to first segment the trees (`segment_trees()`) before creating metrics (`tree_metrics()`). Below we can see an example of a segmented point cloud.

![Figure 15.X A segmented point cloud](images/15-las_segmented.png){width="50%"}

</p>

<p id="box-text">

Creating metrics at these two scales are the fundamental way in which we currently think about analysing forests using LiDAR. Each tells us different things about the forest, so it is important to take scale into account when choosing what kind of analysis you want to do. Below we can see a Leaflet map of some area based metrics created for this point cloud!

### Your Turn!

Explore some of the LiDAR derivatives that we produced in the case study above. We can see how the pattern for maximum height (zmax) follows the mean height (zmean) quite closely. and areas where the standard deviations of heights are very different from one another. In addition, we can see that the 15th percentil of heights (zq15) also broadly follows this pattern. However, we can see that the standard deviation of heights in the tall areas are quite variable, and that very little ground is visible in our tile (as pzabove2 is very high almost everywhere)
