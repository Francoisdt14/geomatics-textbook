LiDAR is an active remote sensing technology that uses a laser scanner and time of flight principles to collect 3 dimensional (3D) data. A LiDAR system is made up of three components; a laser-scanning device, and accurate global navigation satellite system (GNSS), and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The GNSS receiver allows the position of the laser to be determined in space, while the IMU records the orientation of the laser (i.e. roll, pitch, and yaw). When discussing LiDAR in an airborne context, we can also call it airborne laser scanning (ALS). 2.1.1 How does it Work? Typical LiDAR systems use the time of flight method to produce 3D data. A laser ranging instrument produces a short, intense pulse of light from the instrument to a target being measured. Some of this energy is then reflected back to the instrument, where it is recorded (as seen in Figure 15.1). Since the speed of light, and the location of the laser ranging instrument is known, we can calculate the position of the target by timing how long it takes between the the pulse being emitted and received. If we shoot many pulses of light towards a target, we can create a 3D point cloud of our target (see Figure 15.8 as an example of a forest scene). Figure 15.1 Concept of LiDAR. When thinking about a LiDAR dataset, there are several parameters to take note of. It is important to know what the technical specifications of the data collection parameters were (for example, what was is the point density?), and how the data was collected (what plaform was used). A LiDAR dataset includes several pieces of information for each 3D point. X,Y,Z location data is included, as well as information about how the data was collected. In many cases, this includes things like return number, scan angle, gps time, classification, and intensity. We will discuss these concepts in more detail below. The most common file format for LiDAR files is called the LAS file format (.las). This file format was originally designed for 3-dimensional point cloud data, and is a free alternative to proprietary systems or a generic ASCII file interchange system. The main benefits of this file format are that it is relatively quick, can be used by any system, and stores information specific to the nature of LiDAR data without being overly complex. More information regarding the file type specifications can be found here. Figure 15.2 LiDAR System. 2.2 LiDAR History and Use Early LiDAR point densities were low (1 - 5 p/m2), which limited researchers to area based measurements of forest volume and biomass in the 1980s (CITE NELSON 2013). Technological improvements have meant that individual tree crown level analysis is becoming possible (CITE Jakubowski 2013). What kind of technological improvements - specifically pulse rates, storage?

A beam that has low divergence (dinner plate) will be able to distinguish more objects than a high divergence beam (bicycle wheel).  small vs large footprint Target interaction - 7:45 in video 1 Scanning types - zig-zag, rotating mirror line, push broom (call back to RS chapter from Paul) - video 2, 2:08 Technical Specifications of lasers Pulse frequency, scan rate, scan angle return number, gps time, classification, and intensity! Figure 15.3 LiDAR Unit. 2.3.2 Position and Orientation Global Navigation Satellite Systems Require us to know our position exactly! Callback to GNSS? On board GPS and GPS reference stations on the ground are used to post process the data in order to be as accurate as possible Figure 15.4 XYZ Coordinates. Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) An inertial measurement unit (IMU) consists of gyroscopes and accelerometers measures the attitude and acceleration of the aircraft along the X, Y, Z axis. This data is combined with the GNSS data to provide a precise location of the scanner in space. Mentioned elswhere? What is it - focus on image that discusses pitch/roll/yaw Clocks The LiDAR point data needs to be synched with the positioning data in order to know where the point is in space. To do this, a very accurate GPS clock is used to time stamp the laser scanning data (7:30 video 2). Accurate clocks are imperative for producing accurate point clouds. One nanosecond corresponds to a 30 cm travel distance A - (video 1) 2.3.3 Platform LiDAR units can be attached to a variety of platforms. Traditionally, LiDAR units for forestry research were mounted on airplanes and helicopters, as units were large and cumbersome [Figure 15.3], however ground based units such as terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and mobile laser scanning (MLS) have also been developed. These units tend to have a very high point density, and TLS is often used in modeling tree architecture. Plane vs helicopter - what is normal Drone: As technology has improved and laser units have gotten smaller, we can mount LiDAR units to drones (also known as) Figure 15.5 Drone mounted LiDAR.

Can use XYZ  LasTools  FUSION  ArcGIS Pro  CloudCompare Case Study Creating LiDAR Metrics from a Raw Point Cloud For this case study, we will be using a clipped .las file from the 2018 open LiDAR dataset of City of Vancouver and UBC Endowment Lands in British Columbia (we randomly selected a 200 x 200 meter portion of the 4840E_54550N tile, see below for the link where you can download the data), and the lidR package in R. The script to process this data is included HERE [where to include script?], and you can use the lidR book [link] to get a more in depth understanding of the functions we apply below. The first step when looking at LiDAR data is to inspect it; we recommend using the free software CloudCompare (link below), or the plot() function in the lidR package. Once we have a sense of our data, we can clean and filter the data, using classify_noise() and the -drop switch to get rid of the noise in our dataset [include image showing noisy vs. clean data?]. Our cleaned dataset can then be used to create a DEM; first we can classify_ground(), followed by using the grid_terrain() function [call back to previous chapter]  this is an essential step that could require quite a bit of tweaking depending on what you want to use the DEM for! In our case, the DEM is used to normalize the point cloud. Normalization removes the effect of terrain on above ground measurements, allowing comparisons of vegetation heights. [insert image of DEM and CHM]. The normalized point cloud is used to create our CHM (created using grid_canopy()). It is at this point that we can analyze the point cloud in a variety of ways. We can use an area-based approach (ABA) to create metrics at the grid level (grid_metrics()), or we can derive metrics at the individual tree scale. In order to do this we need to first segment the trees (segment_trees()) before creating metrics (tree_metrics()). Below we can see an example of a segmented point cloud.
