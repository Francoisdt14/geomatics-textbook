LiDAR is an active remote sensing technology Alternate names How it works Basic components Multipe types of LiDAR Brief history in forestry / what can we do with LiDAR The most common file format for LiDAR files is called the LAS file format (.las). This file format was originally designed for 3-dimensional point cloud data, and is a free alternative to proprietary systems or a generic ASCII file interchange system. The main benefits of this file format are that it is relatively quick, can be used by any system, and stores information specific to the nature of LiDAR data wihtout being overly complex (:https://www.asprs.org/divisions-committees/lidar-division/laser-las-file-format-exchange-activities).

Traditionally, LiDAR units were mounted on airplanes and helicopters, as units were large and cumbersome [Figure X for actual scanner].

Case Study Creating LiDAR Metrics from a Raw Point Cloud For this case study, we will be using a clipped .las file from the 2018 open LiDAR dataset of City of Vancouver and UBC Endowment Lands in British Columbia (we randomly selected a 200 x 200 meter portion of the 4840E_54550N tile, see below for the link where you can download the data), and the lidR package in R. The script to process this data is included HERE [where to include script?], and you can use the lidR book [link] to get a more in depth understanding of the functions we apply below. The first step when looking at LiDAR data is to inspect it; we recommend using the free software CloudCompare (link below), or the plot() function in the lidR package. Once we have a sense of our data, we can clean and filter the data, using classify_noise() and the -drop switch to get rid of the noise in our dataset [include image showing noisy vs. clean data?]. Our cleaned dataset can then be used to create a DEM; first we can classify_ground(), followed by using the grid_terrain() function [call back to previous chapter]  this is an essential step that could require quite a bit of tweaking depending on what you want to use the DEM for! In our case, the DEM is used to normalize the point cloud. Normalization removes the effect of terrain on above ground measurements, allowing comparisons of vegetation heights. [insert image of DEM and CHM]. The normalized point cloud is used to create our CHM (created using grid_canopy()). It is at this point that we can analyze the point cloud in a variety of ways. We can use an area-based approach (ABA) to create metrics at the grid level (grid_metrics()), or we can derive metrics at the individual tree scale. In order to do this we need to first segment the trees (segment_trees()) before creating metrics (tree_metrics()). Below we can see an example of a segmented point cloud. Case studies should have at least one image or map (no more than 2 total) and the written length should be around 300 words (shown above). Any references to external literature should by hyperlinked with the Digitial Object Identifier (DOI) permanent URL and entered into the bibliography. Avoid linking to external resources without a DOI and permanent URL. Contact Paul or try using the Leaflet package in R if you want to add an interactive web map. Your turn!

Screenshot vs. interactive point cloud - data size concerns Necessity of being able to rotate point cloud? Relatively little gain for trouble of small area.
